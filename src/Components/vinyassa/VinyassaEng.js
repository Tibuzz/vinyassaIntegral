      <p>
        We want to imagine Vinyasa as an integral practice.
         All the practices activate sequences,
          but integration implies traveling routes that achieve deeper connections with breathing,
           singing, philosophy and meditation. Integrating to return to the essence of Vinyasa,
            to become consciousness, to embrace of the practice as a whole that makes the asana meditative.
             Vinyasa Integral recovers the original meaning of Vinyasa to nourish it.
              Vinyasa Integral is a practice of original Vinyasa, a total practice that uses multiple tools to achieve a deep and harmonious practice.
               We think of it in philosophy to feel it with the body. We perceive the posture from the emotion to transform, to come out of the water with some gems that we have brought from the depths of ourselves.
